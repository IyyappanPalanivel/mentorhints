        body:`This AI can exactly do whatever a Software Engineer can do. From creating a code, debugging the code, solving the problems in the code, and testing the code to deployment,
        this AI takes care of all of these tasks. There are many Articles posted regarding this saying that this AI will wipe out all the Software Engineers & establish dominance. Many Articles state that Organizations will prefer to use this AI for cost-cutting.
        
        Our subscribers who read these Articles commented about this like "I just took IT in college. Will I have a career in the future?"; "I am learning a paid course on Full Stack
        Development, will I have a job?" and so on...Because of this hype, I dig deep into it & from my findings, I am shocked! So, is it the End of Software Engineers? Let's Discuss.
        
        I have almost 6+ years of experience in IT and I worked with people who have almost 20+ years of experience. Especially for this blog, I have contacted many Specialists in this specific area and I asked them to share their thoughts on this AI like "how this AI will dominate the software industry?", "how many people will lose their jobs?" and many more… Similarly, many experienced professionals have posted videos on this globally. People with around 30+ years of experience have posted videos on this AI's dominance. My favorite YouTuber, Nosh, posted a video specifically about this. So with this data, I really found some logical stuff.
        
        I'm going to share that stuff in this blog and by the end of this blog, if you are confused about learning full-stack development or coding or want to search job in a different domain rather than IT, this video will give you clarity. Especially, if you are a fresher, you
        didn't even enter the IT industry, but after seeing this software, you might have a mindset to not study. If you are, then watch this video till the end so you guys can understand what's going on and what will happen. 
        
        Alright. First, let's see what a Software Engineer does. For Web Development, if a Full Stack Developer is given a task, they are provided with a basic idea of how it looks and also its basic functionalities for the overall business. Based on that, first, they start designing, After that, they develop where they get some bugs. So they resolve the bugs, then test it & finally bring it to production. Like they bring it for LIVE usage. In the process, if the developer doesn't know how to start with this new project, they will search their old data and take a reference from that. If they don't get the answers there, they search in Google or Stack Overflow.
        
        Once they have a plan, they start the project by executing the code. If they receive Bugs in the code, they will search for why the bug appeared, by completely understanding
        the program and trying to resolve it. As they search in their previous data for similar kinds of errors, they'll ask senior persons, or they self-research using Google & Stack Overflow. They first completely understand the error & then try to resolve it.
        
        This is how Software Engineers create a product. Next, during testing, they check its Functionality such as checking how the code works. They don't start by testing it in the production environment where we use it LIVE. Each application will have a lot of environments in the Backend. Only after a proper execution and working of each of those Backend Environments, it enter into Production. Now you might have an idea of how Software Engineers work. Next, let's see how this Software works. The software itself has its own Command Line, own Code Editor, and an own Browser.
        
        If I want to add an API to this software in order to add a certain function to it I can mention to add this API, along with testing its functions & provide me a complete documentation of the project. First, the software researches the API and its functions using the documentation from the browser, properly understands it, and creates a code based on that. If that code has an error, it researches & debugs it. After debugging, if the code is proper it moves it to testing. There it tests each of the functions for production and finally provides us with the document as output.
        
        Awesome! This software is Great. But if you ask whether this software will replace humans? No! Human Touch is always important in any industry. For example, how AI works is… when we create using this software, it first researches its data for information like whether someone has created software like this. what codes did they use? What are the bugs that appeared? And creates Software based on that information. If a bug appears, this software will research the data & resolve it using the data that was used previously to resolve it If there's a hard problem and it doesn't have that data, then how that AI will solve the problem?
        
        If the error raised is appearing for the first time, then how do they get those data? Ok. Let's see some real-time use cases. WordPress and Shopify. You might have heard these names in a lot of places. They are used for Website Building. Especially, Shopify is used for creating an e-commerce website within an hour, you can mention what specs, and functions you need, what payment gateway you need, etc. It also provides the backend CRM that will be very useful for sales. So for creating a personal blog/ website, you can create it easily using WordPress.
        
        I think these two came nearly 5 to 10 years ago. Do you think there's no demand for web developers now? Web Developers got a very high demand in 2022. Still, there's demand too! This is because each business will have a unique need for their websites and its scaling also differs. So using a prebuilt theme or code won't work properly in this case. And also scaling it up will be quite tedious. Because of this, many Web Developers (React JS/ Angular Developers) are used for creating a proper website. Similar to this, another thing was famous, 2 years back, ChatGPT. But it's really helpful for a lot of software engineers to solve the problem.
        
        If I don't know something, I'll search for it in Google & will get a lot of results and I have to check & try each result 1 by 1. After trying everything, I need to re-rectify the process again, which will confuse me. For a Fresher, it will be more confusing for them. So, ChatGPT will be very useful for resolving these kinds of issues. if I'm searching for a code, it'll give me the best code. But it won't give the desired output we wanted. We'll make some alterations. 
        While editing those codes, Errors might arise. Uploading those errors to ChatGPT will give you a lot of solution ideas. Like this, using ChatGPT, I can speed up my workflow & complete the project sooner. Ok. Let's leave coding and see a simple use case. A few months before, many said that YouTube videos made using ChatGPT, can earn in Lakhs and Crores.
        
        Using ChatGPT take a topic and ask for 10 subtopics. It will give you the output. If you ask for scripts for those topics, it'll generate that too. For that Script, you can give a voice-over, using AI. Also, you can create an image with a person for that using an AI and merge the voice and image using another AI. Finally, for SEO you can use some of the SEO AI tools available. Now you can upload this completed video on YouTube. Many said that these kinds of Automated videos will get more views easily. It was very popular at that time but is it a success? No! Answer this simple question. How many of you are watching AI-based video content? I do not have even 1 channel like that in my subscription. I think maybe 1 out of 10 people, might follow AI-based channels.
        
        But not all people are watching completely AI-based content. Because everyone needs a Human Touch. If an AI speaks here instead of me, you'll feel so bored. Even though it provides you a good content, you'll feel so bored. But we can't say that ChatGPT is not useful. It is very useful, if I'm creating a script, I cannot create it in a proper sentence. If I'm sending a script to someone for editing, it must be in a proper sentence. For this, the AI
        will be really useful. For research purposes, if I use Google, it will show a lot of results to go through and it'll be very difficult to find which data is legit. Here, if I use ChatGPT it'll give me some results. Based on that if I start my research, it'll be less time-consuming.
        
        Like this AI will be helpful for us & if you ask will it replace us? No! One last use case. Think, when research was started on Self Driving Cars. Like did they start in the 20s or 1990s or maybe after 2010? Comment down an Average year like these. I'll hold the video for 3 seconds. Actually, it was started in 1930s. You can refer to Wikipedia. In the 1930s they brought the concept & started to research. Now it's 2024. It's almost 100 years! How many self-driven cars do you see till now? See. After bringing the concept of "Self-Driven", it's useful for us in many ways. Like the Reverse camera sensors while reversing a car, and in advanced costly cars, AI is helpful in a lot of ways. Like this AI will be useful only for making advancements and I don't think it'll completely replace humans. As of my knowledge, nothing happened like that.
        
        And one last question. For how many levels will a high-priority company use this AI? I'm working in a Fortune 500 company, and a top-level company on a financial basis. We should not use ChatGPT in our company. Many companies are not allowed to use AI. As of my knowledge, many highly secure companies don't allow to use of AI. To explain to you deeper, TCS fined DXC, for 210 million dollars in a lawsuit. Do you know why? It's because DXC used one of TCS's codes. It looks like a Software Engineer transferred the code to DXC, and that DXC person used that code without removing the TCS tag. So while creating documentation there arose a problem & TCS found & filed a lawsuit. I don't have a very clear idea on this matter. I read it somewhere. You can find the article by searching or I'll
        just provide you the link in the description. Since they filed a lawsuit for reusing the code, just think, about the uniqueness of the code generated by AI. The world is in this stage & how humans can be replaced in this situation? Do you think we'll be replaced in 1 or 2 years? THINK TWICE!
        
        Cognitive AI, who created this AI says that this AI software is not for replacing humans. Instead, it'll act as a buddy for them. It was created to speed up the work process of humans. Another thing to understand is… When something is introduced, it only shows its best positive side. If Apple brings a new phone, it highlights its best features like its Camera. Its defects will be found only after we use it. This is similar to software too. Here, initially, they showed openly what's better in this AI. But we'll be only able to find the errors and problems after repeated usage. And by the launch of this product, they raised a lot of funds. 
        I saw them raise 21 million dollars. So it's all Business. Don't get fear! In case you're studying a course or you're in 1st year, just Focus On Your Studies!
        
        Instead of worrying about these, Focus on your Work! Learning will never get wasted. It'll be always useful somewhere in your life. Just keep that mindset & learn. If you have a mindset that AI arrived and there are no Software Engineers, you'll leave learning code & also get confused about what to learn new. Instead of being like that, throw away all the rumors. Learn. But do one thing without fail. Whatever you learn, know how to implement AI on it & work smartly. That's what is in Demand now.
        
        Share this blog with your demotivating friend who says that coding won't exist in the future. Mainly share it with your friend who is really demotivated about this concern.

        description:
            `LinkedIn is one of the top job-searching platforms. Nearly, 67 million companies use
        LinkedIn for their hiring process. For every minute, 6 people are getting hired on LinkedIn. For each day, around 6.5 million people apply for jobs on Linkedin.

        body:`LinkedIn is one of the top job-searching platforms. Nearly, 67 million companies use
        LinkedIn for their hiring process. For every minute, 6 people are getting hired on LinkedIn. For each day, around 6.5 million people apply for jobs on Linkedin.
        
        These statistics clearly show that many jobs are available. Even though there are many vacancies, we struggle to get a single job. I think, there are only two reasons for this. First thing,
        
        NO SEO-BASED PROFILE:  
        So, you may ask, are we blogging? Why do we need it to be SEO-based? But, for example, if you search for 'Java Developer' under 'People' on Linkedin, a list of developers will appear. Among them, will be a person who appears in the first position. So, why he is on 1st position? 
        It’s because of SEO! Similarly, if I want to hire a fresher Java Developer for my Startup company on Linkedin, I'll search 'Java Developers Fresher’ and give more importance to the first 10 people who appear on the results by either sending them an email
        to apply the requirement (or) directly ping and reach them. Similar to this, if your profile appears at the top of the list, many openings will come to you. So, SEO is very important. Since, many neglect this, they don't get any interview calls. The second thing is, 
        
        PROFESSIONAL PROFILE:
        Let us say that your profile’s SEO is perfect and appears on the top rank in searches. For example, you search for Java Developer and your profile appears among the top 20 on the list. But when visiting your profile, if it doesn't look professional and looks a bit clumsy, then there is no use in your updated SEO profile. Right? So create a proper profile.
         
        Because of the lack of the above two reasons, most of the people don't get their interview calls. So how to solve that problem?
         
            Read this blog till the end and execute those steps in your profile. If you wonder, how do I know these things? I have been working in the IT field for about 6 years and in that period, I have attended a lot of interviews. I got most of the interviews from the LinkedIn platform & some of them from the Naukri platform. If I want to jump a company, I will do some steps that will show my profile at the top ranking. 
        
        Recently, I did this too. For nearly, 5-6 months, I didn't touch my Naukri profile. I did some updates on it, especially for this blog. I will show the screenshot of how much my profile got pumped up like how many recruiters saw my profile. 
        
        
        I also recommended it to one of my friends. See how much his profile got pumped up.
        
        
        He is getting 5-6 interview calls daily, because of the demand his domain has and he also has a proper skill as well. But it's secondary. I have talked about it in many of my previous YouTube videos, but, if you are not getting any interview calls, this blog will help you.
        
        For a long time, I thought of creating a LinkedIn page, especially for our community. Apart from my career-based profile, I wanted to create that kind of LinkedIn page for a long
        time to post our content. Let’s begin.
        
            •	PROFILE CREATION:
        It has four important steps. 
            •	Profile Picture
            •	Banner
            •	Headline
            •	Profile Section. 
        
        Updating these four things properly creates a great profile. Most of the fresher
        profiles that I have seen, don't have a proper profile section. They don't have a proper headline & they will have a default banner. But if you see their Instagram profile, it will be great. I'm not telling you, all those freshers are doing that. But if you're one of those person, read this blog completely and create a proper profile.
        
            •	PROFILE PICTURE:
        For setting up a profile picture, if you use a selfie of you with your friends, or a picture of you on the beach where you are wearing funky casuals, then that won't work. Even if you rank at the top in a search but your profile picture doesn't make a good impression, then how a recruiter will trust you? So create a Professional DP. 
        Professional doesn't mean you need to go to a Photo Studio. If you have a phone and you have a light. Under proper lighting, take a photo where you are wearing a shirt or a proper T-shirt, that is, a plain T-shirt. Don't wear T-shirts that have text. Wear a plain T-shirt and take a straight view or a side view photo of yours, both will work fine. I think if you turn a bit on your sides, it'll be stylish & more attractive.
        
            •	BANNER
        In the case of a banner, you need to concentrate on the skills you know. For example, if you're a Java Developer, have an image that symbolizes Java, and then you can mention your Achievements, like, “I have resolved this much of Leetcode problems” or like “I got this rank in an event in HackerRank” or like “I have completed a lot of problems and got stronger in one particular area” and other similar kinds of stuff can be made as an image and can be portraited in a banner. 
        If you don't know how to create a banner, just go to canva.com, a really simple platform that is also free of cost. If you search for 'LinkedIn Banners' there, you'll find many banner formats and fonts. You can just add up what you need and there are also many YouTube videos to guide you. Just watch one or two videos and you can easily understand how to use it.
        :
            •	HEADLINE
        Third, a very important one, Headline. The SEO comes in here. So, your Profile Picture and Headline show your professionalism. But to be in the top rank of the SEO list, you should follow your SEO in the headline as well. If I'm a DevOps Engineer, it must be like, “DevOps Engineer in X company | skill I have experience (like if I am an expert in Automation) | I will mention 'Expert in Automation' | then I will mention, a specific Area/ Tool in which I am expertise in. If I am an expert in Kubernetes, I will mention that or I will mention which specific Cloud I am an expert in like AWS or Azure. 
        It'll be easy for an experienced person. But in the case of a Fresher, they need to be very careful with the headline. You need to consider two things. First, what skills do you know? If you know Java Development along with Microservices, you need to mention both. And you need to add it to SEO-based words.
        For that, there are two ways. There is a website called 'Resume Worded', where you can create a headline. It shows the filtered results of the top-ranking people's headlines so that you can filter and take out the headline for your reference.
        Another one is ‘MonkeyLearnwebsite.com’. If you studied Java Development, take ten jobs based on it. That is, take ten jobs launched for freshers and copy their Job Descriptions & paste them on the website. It'll show you which specific keywords are used repeatedly. You need to pick up and use the keyword with the higher rank. 
        There's another important but simple thing. Just go to the LinkedIn search bar and type Java Developer. Similar to Google, SEO words appear below the search bar like ‘Java Developer Fresher’, ‘Java Developer with Microservices’, or a specific Developer kind of words that will appear. 
        These are the words that are most often used for searching. So you can use those words. Instead of Java Developer, if the word Java Developer Fresher has a higher rank, you should use that word.
        
            •	BIO:
        In the Bio section, you can use a lot of SEO words that you found out. But the problem is that using a lot of SEO words will confuse the Algorithm. So make it simple and take 5 - 6 strong keywords. Use them again & again for creating your Bio.
        In the bio's first line, mention the course you completed and the skills you have. Add something catchy in the second line. I'm not saying you to use the bio in Instagram like 'I was born for this' or 'I'm a kind of king in this area'. Instead, use a catchy line like, “I did an internship and got an appreciation” or “Because of my internship, there is this much positive impact on the business.”
        The remaining paragraph must contain only SEO. As said previously, have 5-6 or at maximum 8 keywords. Use them to create a paragraph. Instead of complicating, use a proper paragraph with no grammatical errors. Add what you have worked on, like if you worked on a project, you can elaborate on what you have done on the project.
        If you don't know how to create a paragraph without grammatical errors, there's one website called QUILLBOT. On this website, if you copy and paste a paragraph you have created, it will correct the grammatical errors and provide a proper paragraph. If you want the paragraph to change into a US accent or Canadian accent, it can also be done. Like this, you can choose which accent you want. 
        It’s a good website and I used it to send some emails. Either sending a personal email or an office email, it's really useful for me. If you are an IT professional, definitely use that website man.
        
            •	PROFILE SECTION:
        It consists of three things. 
            •	Core
            •	Recommended
            •	Additional
        If you ask me, I will fill in all three things. If you have a high test score, you can fill it in the additional section. The Core is a very important section. Fill it mandatorily. In case you're unable to fill in the Additional and Recommended sections, you can ignore them.
        But fill the core section which includes your Education, Skill, etc. Skills are very important. That's a keyword, if you are a Java Developer, add 'Java Developer'. If you know any tools, add them. Like if you have learned MySQL, Kubernetes, or Genkids; add them too. It will boost your profile rank. So, skills are important.
        But don't just add all the skills. Only add what you know. Don't overload your profile. Overloading your profile will confuse the Algorithm. So don't do that.
         
        Rather than using LinkedIn for job searching, many creators use it for content creation. What most content creators say is, DON'T CONFUSE THE ALGORITHM! Besides the required data, if we dump a lot of additional data, it will get confused. It won't show your profile in the trends. This is just one side.
        On the other side, many people will create and leave the profile, thinking that they will get job calls. LinkedIn doesn't work like that. We need to do many more things. What do we need to do?
        
        
        Let us go to the second part of the video. TIPS. So I'm about to give 8 tips. If you follow these 8 tips, you can get the best track.
            •	Refer Same Profile: 
        We need to copy. Seem to be funny but that's a fact. As said before, in the People filter if you search for Java Developer, a person will be in the first position. Research why his profile appeared in the first position. See whether he added the same keyword as you. Like whether you added the keyword that he added. Also, see what he had done additionally and add it to your profile.
            •	Network:
        How many connections do you have? In statistics, on average, a content creator or even a top-ranked job searcher must have a minimum of 1200 connections. That's a standard. If you have 1200 connections or more, then the algorithm tries to push your profile upwards. Initially, you cannot make that 1200 connections. But if you work for 3 months, 4 months; you can reach that level. Randomly giving connection requests won't help you to create a good profile. Give requests to those who are all in the same or relevant domain. Like if you're a Java Developer, you can start giving connection requests to other Java Developers. Especially, use filters.
        Next, if you have a dream company or you know a good company, just search the company, go to filter, type people, and send a request to all the people on the list. Send a request to HR & Management people. Whether they accept or not, just give a request. And the third one, they accepted your request but if you irritate them they will cancel the request and go. So turn off the notification. In LinkedIn, if you update your profile or if you see another person's profile, I will notify that person. When you update something, a notification will be sent to all of your connections. Likewise, if there is a lot of notification about a person for a lot of time, it will be very irritating. So turn these two off.
        
            •	Post video: 
        If you say you are not a content creator to post videos, don't post those kinds of content. Rather post demonstration videos of your projects.  And then, post tips using small slides, which can be done using Canva. If you find a good post, comment on it & reshare it. Mostly, if you create your posts, you can build a good network. So that network on Linkedin is very important.
        
            •	Active Times Matters: 
        Of course. Based on your active time also, the algorithm ranks your profile. So, if you're a job searcher, reduce Instagram time & increase LinkedIn time. Customize URL. You can customize the URL & can add your name. So customize depending on your needs.
        
            •	Endorsement.
         Most of the people don't know about this. Recently I came to know about it. What that is... if you worked in a company; your manager or your director or your senior person can mark you as a good person in your profile. Even your clients can give you a review like you are an honest guy, a hard-working guy, or a person who works after hours too. Like this, if you get a good review, your profile will rise. if you want to be a freelancer in the future, these kinds of reviews are very important. If you are working with a top client and they give you a positive review, that's too good!
        But if you're a fresher, ask your professor or HOD. Request them to give a review of your profile's endorsement. That will give you an add-on value to your profile. So, try it. Recently I've also trying to get endorsement for my profile from my previous company colleagues So you try it too. So these are the tips, I would like to share with you. I have created my profile. You can see for any changes in the future. Follow my profile. The link is given below.
